# 🚦 CongestiQ AI – Traffic Congestion Prediction System

CongestiQ AI is an intelligent traffic congestion prediction system that helps identify congestion risks **before they escalate**. It combines real-time weather data, traffic conditions, and safety compliance factors to provide early warnings and actionable insights for smart city traffic management.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Urban traffic congestion is usually detected only after it has already formed, leading to delayed responses, increased travel time, fuel wastage, and higher accident risks. Existing systems lack predictive intelligence and fail to explain why congestion occurs.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

CongestiQ AI adopts a **predictive and explainable approach** to traffic management. It analyzes traffic density, vehicle speed, peak-hour conditions, accidents, road construction, real-time weather parameters, and safety compliance indicators to estimate congestion risk in advance.

The system outputs a congestion percentage, classifies it as Low, Moderate, or High, and provides recommended actions for better traffic control.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User enters the city name
2. Real-time weather data is fetched
3. Traffic and safety inputs are provided
4. Risk scores are calculated for traffic, weather, and safety
5. Final congestion percentage is generated
6. Congestion level and recommendations are displayed

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

Make sure you add your OpenWeather API key in Streamlit secrets.
